# VoxelMan
##Voxel-space based Python game engine

Created using Python and some additional libraries (pygame, numpy, numba, noise)
The terrain is generated using Perlin noise (2D)

##includes: simple water system, realtime terrain editing, FPS camera

#The default key-bindings (can be changed from code):

##W,A,S,D - player movement
##Mouse - player camera rotation
##R - enable/disable edit mode
##UP, LEFT, RIGHT, DOWN ARROWS - move edit-rect (when edit mode is enabled)
##SPACE - destroy selected area (when edit mode is enabled)
##T - enable/disable water
##ESCAPE - quit game
##SHIFT - fast movement (in combination with W,A,S,D)
##Q/E - move down/up

#Additional notes

Everything can be changed from code, such things as octaves, scale for perlin noise, size (width and height) of map, color of ground, color of water, key-bindings, etc!

#License
This code can be freely used for any goals, projects (may be games, lol)
